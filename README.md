# fileTAR
fileTAR is a vs code extension fork of the file tree auto resize extension for atom text editor.
This fork is written in vanilla js while the original is coffeescript.
I really enjoy vscode as an editor, but this is extenstion was one of my favorites on atom.
The extension allows you to drag your file explorer to a desired width, then resize itself if based on open folder/file names
that exceed the pre set width.
